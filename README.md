This model can predict the wine variety based on the reviews given as input.
The machine learning model used here is Neural Network and the library used for the model is Keras.
Model Accuracy: 89.49%
The top 10 words(adjectives after omitting stop words) from the data can be inferred from the graph that has been plotted along with the frequency distribution of the words occuring in the review description.
